# Framework

The configuration files are in `src/configs.py`. Set up the right data path first:
`DATA_DIR` - path to store dataset folder (extracted frames)

`ROOT_DIR` - path to source code folder

## Pre-Processing

Download the model checkpoints for `srl` in folder `pre_process`[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CivhsX0xGxRda9EkZ6uqM_CMaJV40KMO?usp=share_link) and place it in folder `src/pre_process/weight/`

```
1. bash scripts/prepare_pre_process.sh
2. bash scripts/pre_process.sh
```

## Training

```
bash scripts/train.sh
```

## Inference

Change the `INFERENCE_FROM` in your configuration file to the checkpoints downloaded in folder `recognition` and `retrieval` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CivhsX0xGxRda9EkZ6uqM_CMaJV40KMO?usp=share_link), and run the below bash scripts to extract embeddings and ranking the query videos.

```
bash scripts/inference.sh
```

## Post-Processing & Submission

```
bash scripts/post_process.sh
```
